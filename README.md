# AzureWireGuard - Azure Bicep Template
The quickest way to setup your own modern VPN server. 

[WireGuard][wireguard] VPN is a rethink of how VPN software are designed and is receiving genuine appreciation from the community. This [Azure Bicep template][azure-bicep] helps you to setup a WireGuard VPN server quickly, taking care of all the configuration steps. 

# What does this Azure Bicep template do ?
- Create an [Azure Resource Group][azure-rg]. The name of all resources are generated automatically to avoid any conflicts.
- Create an [Ubuntu Server][ubuntu] Virtual Machine.
    - You will be prompted for a password during the deployment.
- A [Network Security Group][azure-nsg] with firewall rules is attached to the Virtual Machine.
    - Port 123 is enabled for WireGuard
    - Port 22 is enabled for SSH. Disable this port once you download the config files and enable it only for maintenance.
- Install WireGuard Server.
- Configure WireGuard Server
    - Create Private and Public Keys for Server and Client.
    - Create the Server Configuration.
    - The WireGuard interface IP address is set to 10.13.13.1.
- Setup NAT on the server to forward client traffic to the internet.
- Start the WireGuard Interface.
- Configure WireGuard to auto start.
- Generate ten client configuration files, which you can download and start using. 
    - The ten clients are given the IP addresses 10.13.13.101 to 10.13.13.110.
    - The Client DNS server is set to [1.1.1.1][dns].
- Enable [UFW][ufw] firewall.
- Install Ubuntu Server Upgrades.
- Schedule a Reboot after 24 hours, to ensure all Ubuntu Server Upgrades are applied.

# How to deploy ?
Some knowledge of how [Azure Bicep templates][azure-bicep] work is really helpful.

## Method 1 - From [Azure CLI][azure-bicep-cli]
- Clone the [git repository][git-repo].
- Login to your Azure subscription

    `az login`
- (Optional Step ... In case you have multiple Azure subscriptions) List your Azure subscriptions

    `az account list --output table`
- (Optional Step ... In case you have multiple Azure subscriptions) Set your default Azure subscription to which this Bicep template will be deployed

    `az account set --subscription <SubscriptionId>`
- (Optional Step ... In case you want to validate the template) Run a [what-if][azure-bicep-whatif] check 

    `az deployment sub create --name wireguard --location eastus --template-file .\AzureWireGuard\AzureWireGuard.bicep --what-if`
- Deploy the Bicep template with defaults. For customization refer to [this](#customizing-the-deployment).

    `az deployment sub create --name wireguard --location eastus --template-file .\AzureWireGuard\AzureWireGuard.bicep`

## Other Methods
- There are multiple ways to deploy an Azure Bicep template like  [Powershell][azure-bicep-ps], [VS Code][azure-bicep-vscode] and [Azure Portal Cloud Shell][azure-bicep-cs].

# Customizing the deployment
- While deploying the Bicep template you can pass a parameters file

    `az deployment sub create --location eastus --template-file ./AzureWireGuard/AzureWireGuard.bicep --parameters ./AzureWireGuard/AzureWireGuard.parameters.json`

- The template parameters available for customization are

    | Parameter | Description | Defaults |
    | --------- | ----------- | -------- |
    | code          | A string used in the resource  names | Random string to avoid resource conflicts. `uniqueString` Based on the Subscription Id and Location |
    | adminUsername | Admin Username for the Virtual Machine | vmadmin |
    | adminPassword | Password for the Virtual Machine | Prompts during deployment |
    | location      | Location to deploy the resources. The location specified in the `az deployment` command does not control the location of the resources. It is the location of the Azure Deployment | eastus |
    | vmSize        | Size of the Virtual Machine | Standard_DS2_v2 |
    | tags          | Tags that are attached to the resources created | DeployedOn |

# How to download WireGuard Client Configuration files ?
- The client configuration files are named wg0-client-1.conf, wg0-client-2.conf, ..., wg0-client-9.conf and wg0-client-10.conf.
- They are located in the administrator users home folder (~/).
- You can use tools like scp and pscp to download the client configuration files directly from the server.
    
    `scp <admin-user>@<server-fqdn>:/home/<admin-user>/wg0-client-1.conf /local/dir/`
    
    `pscp <admin-user>@<server-fqdn>:/home/<admin-user>/wg0-client-1.conf c:\local\`

    Example: 

	`scp vmadmin@pip-wg-j5lzwixbj3ng.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:/home/vmadmin/wg0-client* /local/dir/`

# Windows Clients
- The client configuration files generated have Linux Line Endings (LF) while Windows WireGuard clients would expect DOS Line Endings (CRLF).

# General Recommendations
- While editing the AzureWireGuard.sh script file on Windows use Linux EOL. Windows EOL will cause script failure.
- Recommended to have a VM with atleast two cores.
- Once the configuration files are downloaded, you can disable the SSH port 22 on the Azure Network Security Group for added security.
- [Azure Accelerated Networking][azure-accelerated-nw] is enabled by default for better network performance, this limits the choice of Azure VM sizes.

# Azure ARM Version
The earlier version of AzureWireGuard used [Azure ARM templates][azure-arm]. It is no longer maintained but is available on the branch named [arm-retired][git-repo-retired]

# Helpfull Commands

- list the resource groups in a sub

    `az deployment sub list --output table`

- delete a resource group


    `az deployment sub delete -n SomeDeployment`


- list the resource groups in a sub

    `az group list --output table`


- delete a resource group

    `az group delete --name SomeResourceGroup`

- one liner to replace the port number

    `grep -r -l <oldPort> * | xargs sed -i 's/<oldPort>/<newPort>/g'`
